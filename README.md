LAST UPDATED AUGUST 22ND

Learning to use Python with several data tools linked below, for transparency, I like to post where I get my data from and any sources/inspirations. Since the football season started in early August, I have learnt a lot and made some new visuals.


## Where I get my data 

WhoScored.com - Match Data 
WyScout - Football Stats  (Paywall)
FBref - Football stats (Free)
